Telemedicine Database Management System


Telemedicine Database Management System will be leveraging the concept of telemedicine to provide consultation to patients from certified doctors via video conferencing calls. The system will be having an integrated database consisting of doctors, patients, chemists and medicines based on their location. This system will eventually let patients get doorstep consultation from renowned doctors which will be hassle free. This system will also help people living in remote parts of town who do not have easy access to hospitals and clinics. Financially weaker sections of the society will also be benefitted by this system as our organization will be providing them consultation at nominal rates.


Designed Solution

• All the AMA registered doctors who are willing to work with our organization will connect with our system.
• The customers will be patients who will register themselves on our system to get consultations from doctor at their doorstep.
• Chemists in an area will also sign up with our system.
• Patients will provide a brief description and history about their ailments while booking for
a new consultation.
• Patients can opt for a free delivery of medicines as well from their nearby chemists.
• Doctors will select the time slots when they are free and available. They can just switch on
the online button during that time slot so they will be visible to customers when patients
are booking the appointments online.
• Once the patient provides information of ailment and selects the doctor they want to consult
with, they will be prompted to pay a nominal fee.
• After the patient finish their transaction, they will be directly connected with the doctor via
video conferencing. The patient can call back again in the next half hour if there is a call
drop due to any reason.
• Once the doctor is done with the consultation, he will prescribe medicines to the patient.
The list of medicines will be texted and emailed to the patient. If the patient has opted for a free home delivery of the medicines, the same prescription will be emailed to the chemist as well.
