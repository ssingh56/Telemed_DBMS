Telemedicine Database Management System


Telemedicine Database Management System will be leveraging the concept of telemedicine to provide consultation to patients from certified doctors via video conferencing calls. The system will be having an integrated database consisting of doctors, patients, chemists and medicines based on their location. This system will eventually let patients get doorstep consultation from renowned doctors which will be hassle free. This system will also help people living in remote parts of town who do not have easy access to hospitals and clinics. Financially weaker sections of the society will also be benefitted by this system as our organization will be providing them consultation at nominal rates.
